## Who is a web developer?

A **web developer** is at heart an interactive artist. They’re someone driven by a deep desire to create things. A web developer’s canvas is a user’s web browser 

## Types of web developers

There are different types of web developers who focus on different areas. These include:

***Frontend developers:*** Frontend developers implement web page designs using HTML and CSS. They make sure the website looks pretty on different devices, and that the forms and buttons work.


***Backend developers:*** Backend developers create the backbone of the web application. They write code logic that handles a user’s input (for example, what should happen when you click the signup button after filling in a form).


***Full stack developers:*** Full stack developers do bits of both backend and frontend. Depending on the problem at hand, they can switch cape 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️ and move stacks.

# 3 ESSENTIAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES FOR EVERY WEB DEVELOPER:

#### Our world is changing:

With the constant introduction of new technology in today’s society, new careers and opportunities are always becoming available to those who are entering our workforce. As countless organizations and corporations are scrambling to adapt to the technological innovations of the twenty-first century, employees with the skills to fill and excel in these tech support positions are in increasingly high demand. At the forefront of this revolution is the growing pressure for businesses for develop a strong online presence. This drive has led to a powerful demand for employees who possess skills in web development and social media marketing. The power to build a webpage has become the power to find opportunity in today’s job market.

At this point, you may be thinking **“Okay, I’ll bite. Where do I start?”** There are three main programming languages that are an essential part of the web developer’s arsenal: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of these languages have their own unique characteristics and uses, and are equally important in the creation of an effective and enticing webpage. While each language is a powerful tool by itself, they are designed to be compatible with each other and are best used in conjunction.

1. >## HTML

- HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is primarily used in the creation of the webpage skeleton. It is the most important of the three languages that this post will cover. HTML is responsible for creating the “physical” elements of the webpage. Elements such as links, text, images/video, dividers, and others are inserted into the webpage through HTML. It essentially forms the webpage’s skeleton. All other languages that are incorporated in web development are implemented around HTML and are spaced in specific areas according to the tags used in the HTML code.
 #### Example For Html:
```
<dev>
    <h1>Web developer</h1>
    <p>any paragraph you want</p>
</div>

```
#### Writting comments in html:

```
<!--"this is a comment" -->
```

#### the figure below shows the recommended minimum skeleton of an HTML5 document:

1. Document type declaration (also called DOCTYPE declaration) that identifies this document as an HTML5 document.
1. The entire document is contained within an html element. The html element is called the root element because it contains all the elements in the document.
1. Within the html element, the document is divided into a head and a body. The head element contains descriptive information about the document itself, such as its title, the style sheet(s) it uses, scripts, and other types of “meta” information.
1. The meta elements within the head element provide information about the document itself.
1. Also in the head is the mandatory title element. According to the HTML specification, every document must contain a descriptive title.
1. The body element contains everything that we want to show up in the browser window.

2. >## CSS

- CSS, or cascading style sheets, is the simplest of the three languages. HTML is primarily used to create the practical structure of a website. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the elements of the webpage that are created through HTML. Colors, fonts, borders, and other characteristics are all controlled through CSS.

#### Example For Css:
```
.body{
    background-color: #0000ff;
    margin: 100%;
}
```
--- 

3. >## JAVASCRIPT

- Finally, the last of the three languages we will talk about today is JavaScript. While it is not required, JavaScript is commonly used to add an air of interactivity to websites of all kinds. JavaScript is object-oriented and is ideal for the creation of interactive programs such as games, apps, and other interfaces. It is also commonly used in conjunction with HTML to create websites that interact with their users.

![js](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svrFJeLTvHI/hqdefault.jpg)
#### Example For Javascript:
```
var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!';
function updateMessage() {
var el = document.getElementByld('message'};
el .textContent = msg;
}
updateMessage(};
``` 
## Linking a JavaScript file from an HTML page You can include JavaScript in your HTML in two ways:

#### Writing the code in your HTML

```
<script>

var i nStock;
var shipping;
inStock = true;
shipping= fa l se;
var elStock = document.getElementByld('stock');
elStock.className = inStock;
var el Ship = document .getElementByid('shipping');
elShip.className = sh ipping ;

</script>
```


#### Including it as a link to an external file:

```
<script src="js/external-file.js"></script>
```


 As we are constantly moving towards technological advancement, every industry in the job market is striving to adapt to a more digital world, and those who have the skills to fill those tech-support positions have the chance to make an impact and secure a career. Learning those three coding languages will offer you many benefits, and, above all else, opportunity.
