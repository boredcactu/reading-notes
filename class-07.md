## Domain Modeling:

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

### Model epic fails videos :

Imagine you've been tasked to build a program that models the popularity of epic fail videos. After months of painstaking research, you've determined that the two essential metrics for gauging popularity are an epic rating and whether or not the video has animals.

Since you'll be modeling the popularity of many types of videos—parkour epic fails, corgi epic fails, etc.—you'll want to build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors. That way, when you need to change the algorithm for determining popularity, the changes will be small and targeted.



As you read this article, type out and run all code samples you come across. Do not copy and paste. Writing out and testing your code will help you remember how to implement domain models in JavaScript later.

## Tables:

The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
You indicate the start of each row using the opening `<tr>` tag. (The tr stands for table row.)
Each cell of a table is represented using a `<td>` element. (The td stands for table data.)
The `<th>` element is used just like the `<td>` element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)
The rowspan attribute can be used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects:

Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and document loaded into browser window.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets(and both can contain the other).
We can change the value of object properties after coling it.
