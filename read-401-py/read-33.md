# React Router

To get started with React Router in a web app, youâ€™ll need a React web app. If you need to create one, we recommend you try Create React App. Itâ€™s a popular tool that works really well with React Router.

Installation
You can install React Router from the public npm registry with either npm or yarn. Since weâ€™re building a web app, weâ€™ll use react-router-dom in this guide.
```
npm install react-router-dom

```

Next, copy/paste either of the following examples into src/App.js.

# React - Styling FAQ

CSS-in-JS refers to a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files.

Note that this functionality is not a part of React, but provided by third-party libraries. React does not have an opinion about how styles are defined; if in doubt, a good starting point is to define your styles in a separate *.css file as usual and refer to them using className.

**To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:**

* Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
* You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
* You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
* You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction â€” otherwise it wonâ€™t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.
