# Whiteboard Advice

![image](../img3/Whiteboard.jpeg)

Whiteboard-style interviews are ubiquitous in the tech industry. For those who not had the pleasure, whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.


In this article, I intend to pass along the best advice I ever received for going through a whiteboard interview. Note that I do not intend to address the fairness or efficacy of whiteboard interviews because, well, as interviewees we currently have to deal with them regardless.

**First, Restate the Question**

Do you understand what theyâ€™re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you donâ€™t fully understand what theyâ€™re asking forâ€Šâ€”â€Šperhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past. 

**Ask About Edge Cases**

Itâ€™s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasnâ€™t even thought about edge cases and will make something up.

**Ask About Test Cases**

This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary

**Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense**

Again, you donâ€™t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. Youâ€™ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic.

**Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good**

You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You donâ€™t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.
