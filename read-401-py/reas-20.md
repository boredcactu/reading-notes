# Intro to Django

With Django, you can take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on **_writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel_**. It’s `free` and `open source`.

## Django Features

1. **_Ridiculously fast_**:

Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

1. **_Fully loaded_**:

Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.

1. **_Reassuringly secure_**:

Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

1. **_Exceedingly scalable_**:

Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

1. **_Incredibly versatile_**:

Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

## How i can install Django

at the first you need to [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Set up a database [database installation information.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/#database-installation) after that You’ve got three options to install Django:

1. [Install an official release](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release). This is the best approach for most users.
1. Install a version of Django [provided by your operating system distribution](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/#installing-distribution-package).
1. [Install the latest development version](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/#installing-development-version). This option is for enthusiasts who want the latest-and-greatest features and aren’t afraid of running brand new code. You might encounter new bugs in the development version, but reporting them helps the development of Django. Also, releases of third-party packages are less likely to be compatible with the development version than with the latest stable release.

### Verifying

To verify that `Django` can be seen by Python, type `python` from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django:

```Python
import django
print(django.get_version())
3.1
# You may have another version of Django installed
```
