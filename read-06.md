### What Is Node.js?

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, itâ€™s a JavaScript runtime.

### What Is Node.js Used For?

Node.js Used For installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools â€” designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

### What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration. Itâ€™s also a good fit for building APIs where youâ€™re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven, or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while theyâ€™re still being uploaded. 

### What Are the Advantages of Node.js?

Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server â€” as well as in the browser â€” is that we can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive. 

Another of Nodeâ€™s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when youâ€™re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.

Finally, JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages. To quote Craig Buckler in his Node vs PHP Smackdown, JavaScript might remain the worldâ€™s most misunderstood language.
