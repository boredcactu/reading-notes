# Forms and Events:

## Forms

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.

The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage

There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site

* Text input
* password input
* Text area
* radio button
* Checkbox
* Drop-down box
* Submit button
* Image button
* file upload

### How Forms Works

A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server

A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.

### `<form>`

Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.

* `<method>` :
Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
### Text input :

The `<input>` element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.

* `type="text"` :

When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input

* `type="password"` :

When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out. They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords.

## Css List, Tables and Forms 

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, and forms.

* `list-style-type` :
The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point (also known as a marker). 

* list-style-image :
You can specify an image to act as a bullet point using the list-style-image property.

* `list-style-position` :
Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-styleposition property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points.
